Build content mangement system by using extension php mysqli and php procedure style

Hi
Recently noticed many beginners in the study of the language of php can not apply what he learned from the courses available on YouTube or sites specialized in distance education and revolves in his mind the frequent question

"" I've finished a PHP course and I do not know how to apply it! ""

Therefore, I decided to work for a specialized channel for the work of courses and videos heritage despite the lack of time and work in the field of cnc

The first course on the channel is
#Course_programming_control_content_content
In other words,

The course will be very extensive and contains very important things and is a cornerstone for your future in the programming world.

The site we will be programming will be very professional and usable for research or marketing
